A webapp simulating a one function calculator, powered by Keras.

Why preform a *simple* task in a *simple way*, when you can preform a simple task in a __really complex__ way?

Machine Learning has been applied to a range of complex and pressing problems: 
[identifying cancer tumors](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2016/11/identifying-skin-cancer-computer-vision/) and [classifiying particle collsions](https://www.nature.com/news/artificial-intelligence-called-in-to-tackle-lhc-data-deluge-1.18922).
However, has anybody ever applied these statistical methods to the addition of two single digit integers? 
Today, [we step into the bold unknown](https://dumb-calculator.herokuapp.com/)!

### Motivations:

I undertook this project to get practice working with Keras. 
I know this problem (regression) isn't a good application of neural nets (suited to classification), but I think the best way to learn a complex technology is to do something simple with it.
Hopefully, this will be worth a laugh, like my [other calculator](https://github.com/BenDavidAaron/bad-calculator), on which this one is based (and heavily derivative of).
